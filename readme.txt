This Plugin replaces the URL base of the communication media who are members of CEDRO and AEDE, two spanish media associations

== Description ==

This Plugin replaces the URL base of the communication media who are members of CEDRO and AEDE, two spanish media 
associations that are trying to approve a law to charge if a web aggregator link to their websites.

This plugin blocks the URLs that link to the media members of AEDE and CEDRO and the references to their URL.

The full list of the blocked media can be seen in this [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AvU0QJhownBGdEVwOFloaFBZaXMyMjdycDNZcTNvdUE&usp=sharing), and has
